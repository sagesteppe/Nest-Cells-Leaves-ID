This was a fun project trying to make data driven keys. The leaf measurements for both *Solidago* and *Erigeron* were made in the field, with most *Morella* measurements originating from randomly selected herbaria records. The scripts detail randomly selecting *Morella* specimens, and comparing some of the traits. Knowledge of which plant species are used derive from M. Mesler, Corey Andrikopolus, and other HSU students.  

## Key Distinguishing *Megachile wheeleri* Nest Cell Materials

1.. Leaf margin essentially entire to few toothed, generally with the few evident teeth separated by > 3.0 mm. If spaces between leaf teeth < 5 mm, than the teeth rarely if ever on angular- to almost blocky (serrate) projections, and essentially always lacking a tiny light gland at the apice. If a leaf apex is present, it is essentially always longer than the pair of leaf teeth adjacent to it. Leaf occasionally with dark glands on one side.... **2**

1'. Leaf margin with several evident teeth, most of these generally separated by < 3.2 mm. If spaces between leaf teeth > 5 mm, than the upper teeth generally found on angular-to almost blocky (serrate) projections, and often with a tiny light gland on the apice. If a leaf apex is present, it occasionally is shorter than the pair of leaf teeth adjacent to it. Leaf never with darkish glands on one side.. **Solidago spathulata**

2.. Leaf margin essentially entire, teeth or undulations when present usually rounded at tips, one surface of leaf not covered densely by dark round glands... **Erigeron glaucus**

2'. Leaf margin with a couple teeth, these oftentimes coming to an evident point and generally pointing forward nearly parallel to the main blade. One side of the leaf covered with dark round glands... **Morella californica**
